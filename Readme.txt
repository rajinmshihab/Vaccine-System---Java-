Same as any other computer program, the program we were instructed to develop is built 
to efficiently manage the vaccination procedure of people. It will be able to provide usability to 
both personnel of the vaccination provider committee as well as the people registering for the 
vaccines. Functionalities for different types of users are mostly different but has similarities. 
The people using the program will be able to register themselves with necessary 
information required. They will be able to apply for vaccination appointment and will be able to 
view or modify any necessary information at any point of time. The personnel of the committee 
will be able to do the similar things that the people themselves can, meaning they will be able to 
register people for vaccination as well as modify their information if necessary. They will also 
have access to extra features such as, managing vaccination centers and vaccination supplies of 
said centers.
